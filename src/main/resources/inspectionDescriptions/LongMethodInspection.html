    Specify the allowable upper limit for "method length".<br>
    The "method length" here refers to the amount of processing.<br>

    <b>How to refactor</b><br>
    1. Go to description of "Long Parameter List" if parameter list is too long.<br>
    2. Execute refactoring of "Replace Temp with Query" if it is not easy to extract as another method because parameters or temporary variables are too many.<br>
    3. Execute refactoring of "Decompose Conditional" if there are complex conditional branches.<br>
    4. Execute refactoring of "Replace Method with Method Object" if parameters or temporary variables exist after you execute refactoring 1 and 2.<br>
    5. Execute refactoring of "Extract Method" if there are parts that can be combined by multiple methods.<br>
